<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">vlmcsd - a
fully Microsoft compatible KMS server</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>vlmcsd</b> [
<i>options</i> ]</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>vlmcsd</b>
is a fully Microsoft compatible KMS server that provides
product activation services to clients. It is meant as a
drop-in replacement for a Microsoft KMS server (Windows
computer with KMS key entered). It currently supports KMS
protocol versions 4, 5 and 6.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>vlmcsd</b>
is designed to run on POSIX compatible operating systens. It
only requires a basic C library with a BSD-style sockets API
and either <b>fork</b>(2) or <b>pthreads</b>(7). That allows
it to run on most embedded systems like routers, NASes,
mobile phones, tablets, TVs, settop boxes, etc. Some efforts
have been made that it also runs on Windows.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Although
<b>vlmcsd</b> does neither require an activation key nor a
payment to anyone, it is not meant to run illegal copies of
Windows. Its purpose is to ensure that owners of legal
copies can use their software without restrictions, e.g. if
you buy a new computer or motherboard and your key will be
refused activation from Microsoft servers due to hardware
changes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>vlmcsd</b>
may be started via an internet superserver like
<b>inetd</b>(8) or <b>xinetd</b>(8) as well as an advanced
init system like <b>systemd</b>(8) or <b>launchd</b>(8)
using socket based activation. If <b>vlmcsd</b> detects that
<b>stdin</b>(3) is a socket, it assumes that there is
already a connected client on stdin that wants to be
activated.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">All options
that control setting up listening sockets will be ignored
when in inetd mode. The sockets will be set up by your
internet superserver. You also cannot limit the number of
simultanous clients (option <b>-m</b>). You need to
configure the limit in your internet superserver.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The followong
features that require that vlmcsd is permanently loaded will
not work if started from an internet superserver:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">You cannot
maintain a client list (option <b>-M1</b>)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">EPID
Randomization Level 1 (option <b>-r1</b>) works like Level 2
(<b>-r2</b>). You may want to use Level 0 (<b>-r0</b>) or
custom EPIDs (options <b>-w</b>, <b>-G</b>, <b>-0</b>,
<b>-3</b> and <b>-6</b>) instead.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Since vlmcsd
can be configured at compile time, some options may not be
available on your system.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">All options
that do no require an argument may be combined with a single
dash, for instance &quot;vlmcsd -D -e&quot; is identical to
&quot;vlmcsd -De&quot;. For all options that require an
argument a space between the option and the option argument
is optional. Thus &quot;vlmcsd -r 2&quot; and &quot;vlmcsd
-r2&quot; are identical too. <b><br>
-h</b> or <b>-?</b></p>

of <b>make</b>(1) by default) to see the meaning of those
flags.</p> </td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-L</b>
<i>ipaddress</i>[:<i>port</i>]</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Instructs vlmcsd to listen on
<i>ipaddress</i> with optional <i>port</i> (default 1688).
You can use this option more than once. If you do not
specify <b>-L</b> at least once, IP addresses 0.0.0.0 (IPv4)
and :: (IPv6) are used. If the IP address contains colons
(IPv6) you must enclose the IP address in brackets if you
specify the optional port, e.g.
[2001:db8::dead:beef]:1688.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If no port is
specified, vlmcsd uses the default port according to a
preceding <b>-P</b> option. If you specify a port, it can be
a number (1-65535) or a name (usually found in /etc/services
if not provided via LDAP, NIS+ or another name service).</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If you specify
a link local IPv6 address (fe80::/10, usually starting with
fe80::), it must be followed by a percent sign (%) and a
scope id (=network interface name or number) on most unixoid
OSses including Linux, Android, MacOS X and iOS, e.g.
fe80::1234:56ff:fe78:9abc<b>%eth0</b> or
[fe80::1234:56ff:fe78:9abc<b>%2</b>]:1688. Windows
(including cygwin) does not require a scope id unless the
same link local address is used on more than one network
interface. Windows does not accept a name and the scope id
must be a number.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-o</b> <i>level</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Sets the <i>level</i> of
protection against activations from public IP addresses. The
default is <b>-o0</b> for no protection.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-o1</b>
causes vlmcsd not to listen on all IP addresses but on
private IP addresses only. IPv4 addresses in the
100.64.0.0/10 range (see RFC6598) are not treated as private
since they can be reached from other users of your ISP.
Private IPv4 addresses are 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12,
192.168.0.0/16, 169.254.0.0/16 and 127.0.0.0/8. vlmcsd
treats all IPv6 addresses not within 2000::/3 as private
addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If <b>-o1</b>
is combined with <b>-L</b>, it will listen on all private IP
addresses plus the ones specified by one or more <b>-L</b>
statements. If <b>-o1</b> is combined with <b>-P</b>, only
the last <b>-P</b> statement will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Using
<b>-o1</b> does not protect you if you enable NAT port
forwarding on your router to your vlmcsd machine. It is
identical to using multiple -L statements with all of your
private IP addresses. What <b>-o1</b> does for you, is
automatically enumerating your private IP addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-o2</b> does
not affect the interfaces, vlmcsd is listening on. When a
clients connects, vlmcsd immediately drops the connection if
the client has a public IP address. Unlike <b>-o1</b>
clients will be able to establish a TCP connection but it
will be closed without a single byte sent over the
connection. This protects against clients with public IP
addresses even if NAT port forwarding is used. While
<b>-o2</b> offers a higher level of protection than
<b>-o1</b>, the client sees that the KMS TCP port (1688 by
default) is actually accepting connections.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If vlmcsd is
compiled to use MS RPC, <b>-o2</b> can only offer very poor
protection. Control is passed from MS RPC to vlmcsd after
the KMS protocol has already been negotiated. Thus a client
can always verify that the KMS protocol is available even
though it receives an RPC_S_ACCESS_DENIED error message.
vlmcsd will issue a warning if <b>-o2</b> is used with MS
RPC. <b>For adaequate protection do not use a MS RPC build
of vlmcsd with -o2</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-o3</b>
combines <b>-o1</b> and <b>-o2</b>. vlmcsd listens on
private interfaces only and if a public client manages to
connect anyway due to NAT port forwarding, it will be
immediately dropped.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If you use any
form of TCP level port forwarding (e.g. <b>nc</b>(1),
<b>netcat</b>(1), <b>ssh</b>(1) port forwarding or similar)
to redirect KMS requests to vlmcsd, there will be no
protection even if you use <b>-o2</b> or <b>-o3</b>. This is
due to the simple fact that vlmcsd sees the IP address of
the redirector and not the IP address of the client.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-o1</b> (and
thus <b>-o3</b>) is not (yet) available in some
scenarios:</p>

<p style="margin-left:29%; margin-top: 1em">FreeBSD: There
is a longtime unfixed
<a href="https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=178881">bug</a>
in the 32-bit ABI of the 64-bit kernel. If you have a 64-bit
FreeBSD kernel, you must run the 64-bit version of vlmcsd if
you use <b>-o1</b> or <b>-o3</b>. The 32-bit version causes
undefined behavior up to crashing vlmcsd. Other BSDs
(NetBSD, OpenBSD, Dragonfly and Mac OS X) work
correctly.</p>

<p style="margin-left:29%; margin-top: 1em">If vlmcsd was
started by an internet superserver or was compiled to use
Microsoft RPC (Windows only) or simple sockets, <b>-o1</b>
and <b>-o3</b> are not available by design.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-P</b> <i>port</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Use TCP <i>port</i> for all
subsequent <b>-L</b> statements that do not include an
optional port. If you use <b>-P</b> and <b>-L</b>, <b>-P</b>
must be specified before <b>-L</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-O</b>
<i>vpn-adapter-name</i>[=<i>ipv4-address</i>][/<i>cidr-mask</i>][:<i>dhcp-lease-duration</i>]</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Enables a compatible VPN
adapter to create additional local IPv4 addresses (like
127.0.0.1) that appear as remote IPv4 addresses to the
system. This allows product activation using a local
instance of vlmcsd. This feature is only available in
Windows and Cygwin builds of vlmcsd since it is not of any
use on other operating systems. Compatible VPN adapters are
Tap-windows version 8.2 or higher (from OpenVPN) and the
TeamViewer VPN adapter. There are two special
<i>vpn-adapter-name</i>s. A single period (.) instructs
vlmcsd to use the first available compatible VPN adapter. A
single dash (-) disables the use of a VPN adapter if one has
been configured in <b>vlmcsd.ini</b>(5). The
<i>vpn-adapter-name</i> is <b>not</b> case-sensitive. If the
<i>vpn-adapter-name</i> contains spaces (e.g. Ethernet 3),
you must enclose it in quotes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The default
<i>ipv4-address</i> is 10.10.10.9 and the default
<i>cidr-mask</i> is 30. If you are using the default values,
your VPN adapter uses an IPv4 address of 10.10.10.9 and you
can set your activation client to use the easy to remember
address 10.10.10.10 (e.g. slmgr /skms 10.10.10.10 or cscript
ospp.vbs /sethst:10.10.10.10).</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>dhcp-lease-duration</i> is a number optionally followed
by s, m, h, d or w to indicate seconds, minutes, hours, days
or weeks. The default <i>dhcp-lease-duration</i> is 1d (one
day). It is normally not required to change this value.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">It is advised
not to manually configure your OpenVPN TAP or TeamViewer VPN
adapter in &quot;Network Connections&quot;. If you set the
IPv4 configuration manually anyway, the IPv4 address and the
subnet mask must match the <b>-O</b> parameter. It is safe
leave the IPv4 configuration to automatic (DHCP). vlmcsd
will wait up to four seconds for the DHCP configuration to
complete before binding to and listenin on any
interfaces.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">You should be
aware that only one program can use a VPN adapter at a time.
If you use the TeamViewer VPN adapter for example, you will
not be able to use the VPN feature of TeamViewer as long as
vlmcsd is running. The same applies to OpenVPN TAP adapters
that are in use by other programs (for example OpenVPN,
QEMU, Ratiborus VM, aiccu, etc.). The best way to avoid
conflicts is to install Tap-Windows from OpenVPN, cd to
C:\Program Files\TAP-Windows\bin and run addtap.bat to
install an additional TAP adapter. Go to &quot;Network
Connections&quot; and rename the new adapter to
&quot;vlmcsd&quot; and specify <b>-O vlmcsd</b> to use
it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Example: <b>-O
&quot;Ethernet 7&quot;=192.168.123.1/24</b> (uses VPN
adapter Ethernet 7 with IPv4 address 192.168.123.1 and have
192.168.123.2 to 192.168.123.254 as additional local (but
apparently remote) IPv4 addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-x0</b> and <b>-x1</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Controls under what
circumstances vlmcsd will exit. Using the default of
<b>-x0</b> vlmcsd stays active as long as it can perform
some useful operations. If vlmcsd is run by any form of a
watchdog, e.g. NT service manager (Windows), systemd (Linux)
or launchd (Mac OS / iOS), it may be desirable to end vlmcsd
and let the watchdog restart it. This is especially true if
some pre-requisites are not yet met but will be some time
later, e.g. network is not yet fully setup.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">By using
<b>-x0</b> vlmcsd will</p>

<p style="margin-left:29%; margin-top: 1em">exit if none of
the listening sockets specified with <b>-L</b> can be used.
It continues if at least one socket can be setup for
listening.</p>

<p style="margin-left:29%; margin-top: 1em">exit any TAP
mirror thread (Windows version only) if there is an error
condition while reading or writing from or to the VPN
adapter but continue to work without utilizing a VPN
adapter.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">By using
<b>-x1</b> vlmcsd will</p>

<p style="margin-left:29%; margin-top: 1em">exit if not all
listening sockets specified with <b>-L</b> can be used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:29%; margin-top: 1em">exit completely
if there is a problem with a VPN adapter it is using. This
can happen for instance if the VPN adapter has been disabled
using &quot;Control Panel - Network - Adapter Settings&quot;
while vlmcsd is using it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Please note
that <b>-x1</b> is kind of a workaround option. While it may
help under some circumstances, it is better to solve the
problem at its origin, e.g. properly implementing
dependencies in your startup script to ensure all network
interfaces and the VPN adapter you will use are completely
setup before you start vlmcsd.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-F0</b> and <b>-F1</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Allow (<b>-F1</b>) or disallow
(<b>-F0</b>) binding to IP addresses that are currently not
configured on your system. The default is <b>-F0</b>.
<b>-F1</b> allows you to bind to an IP address that may be
configured after you started <b>vlmcsd</b>. <b>vlmcsd</b>
will listen on that address as soon as it becomes available.
This feature is only available under Linux (IPv4 and IPv6)
and FreeBSD (IPv4 only). FreeBSD allows this feature only
for the root user (more correctly: processes that have the
PRIV_NETINET_BINDANY privilege). Linux does not require a
capability for this.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-t</b> <i>seconds</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Timeout the TCP connection with
the client after <i>seconds</i> seconds. After sending an
activation request. RPC keeps the TCP connection for a
while. The default is 30 seconds. You may specify a shorter
period to free ressources on your device faster. This is
useful for devices with limited main memory or if you used
<b>-m</b> to limit the concurrent clients that may request
activation. Microsoft RPC clients disconnect after 30
seconds by default. Setting <i>seconds</i> to a greater
value does not make much sense.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-m</b>
<i>concurrent-clients</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Limit the number of clients
that will be handled concurrently. This is useful for
devices with limited ressources or if you are experiencing
DoS attacks that spawn thousands of threads or forked
processes. If additional clients connect to vlmcsd, they
need to wait until another client disconnects. If you set
<i>concurrent-clients</i> to a small value ( &lt;10 ), you
should also select a reasonable timeout of 2 or 3 seconds
with <b>-t</b>. The default is no limit.</p>

<p><b>-d</b></p></td>
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>Disconnect each client after processing one activation
request. This is a direct violation of DCE RPC but may help
if you receive malicous fake RPC requests that block your

py-kms) behave this way.</p></td></tr>

<p>Do not disconnect clients after processing an activation

useful only if you used an ini file (see
<b>vlmcsd.ini</b>(5) and <b>-i</b>). If the ini file
contains the line &quot;DisconnectClientsImmediately =
true&quot;, you can use this switch to restore the default
behavior.</p> </td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-N0</b> and <b>-N1</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Disables (<b>-N0</b>) or
enables (<b>-N1</b>) the use of the NDR64 transfer syntax in
the RPC protocol. Unlike Microsoft vlmcsd supports NDR64 on
32-bit operating systems. Microsoft introduced NDR64 in
Windows Vista but their KMS servers started using it with
Windows 8. Thus if you choose random ePIDs, vlmcsd will
select ePIDs with build numbers 9200 and 9600 if you enable
NDR64 and build numbers 6002 and 7601 if you disable NDR64.
The default is to enable NDR64.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-B0</b> and <b>-B1</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Disables (<b>-B0</b>) or
enables (<b>-B1</b>) bind time feature negotiation (BTFN) in
the RPC protocol. All Windows operating systems starting
with Vista support BTFN and try to negotiate it when
initiating an RPC connection. Thus consider turning it off
as a debug / troubleshooting feature only. Some older
firewalls that selectively block or redirect RPC traffic may
get confused when they detect NDR64 or BTFN.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-l</b> <i>filename</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Use <i>filename</i> as a log
file. The log file records all activations with IP address,
Windows workstation name (no reverse DNS lookup), activated
product, KMS protocol, time and date. If you do not specify
a log file, no log is created. For a live view of the log
file type tail -f <i>file</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If you use the
special <i>filename</i> &quot;syslog&quot;, vlmcsd uses
<b>syslog</b>(3) for logging. If your system has no syslog
service (/dev/log) installed, logging output will go to
/dev/console. Syslog logging is not available in the native
Windows version. The Cygwin version does support syslog
logging.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-T0</b> and <b>-T1</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Disable (<b>-T0</b>) or enable
(<b>-T1</b>) the inclusion of date and time in each line of
the log. The default is <b>-T1</b>. <b>-T0</b> is useful if
you log to <b>stdout</b>(3) which is redirected to another
logging mechanism that already includes date and time in its
output, for instance <b>systemd-journald</b>(8). If you log
to <b>syslog</b>(3), <b>-T1</b> is ignored and date and time
will never be included in the output sent to
<b>syslog</b>(3).</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The native

use <b>-q</b> to restore the default behavior.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-p</b> <i>filename</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Create pid file
<i>filename</i>. This has nothing to do with KMS ePIDs. A
pid file is a file where vlmcsd writes its own process id.
This is used by standard init scripts (typically found in
/etc/init.d). The default is not to write a pid file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-u</b> <i>user</i> and
<b>-g</b> <i>group</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Causes vlmcsd to run in the
specified <i>user</i> and <i>group</i> security context. The
main purpose for this is to drop root privileges after it
has been started from the root account. To use this feature
from cygwin you must run cyglsa-config and the account from
which vlmcsd is started must have the rights &quot;Act as
part of the operating system&quot; and &quot;Replace a
process level token&quot;. The native Windows version does
not support these options.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The actual
security context switch is performed after the TCP sockets
have been created. This allows you to use privileged ports

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-H</b> <i>HwId</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Use <i>HwId</i> for all
products. All HWIDs in the ini file (see <b>-i</b>) will not
be used. In an ini file you can specify a seperate HWID for
each <i>application-guid</i>. This is not possible when
entering a HWID from the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><i>HwId</i>
must be specified as 16 hex digits that are interpreted as a
series of 8 bytes (big endian). Any character that is not a
hex digit will be ignored. This is for better readability.
The following commands are identical:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-i</b> <i>filename</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Use configuration file (aka ini
file) <i>filename</i>. Most configuration parameters can be
set either via the command line or an ini file. The command
line always has precedence over configuration items in the
ini file. See <b>vlmcsd.ini</b>(5) for the format of the
configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If vlmcsd has
been compiled to use a default configuration file (often
/etc/vlmcsd.ini), you may use <b>-i-</b> to ignore the
default configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-j</b> <i>filename</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Use KMS data file
<i>filename</i>. By default vlmcsd only contains the minimum
product data that is required to perform all operations
correctly. You may use a more complete KMS data file that
contains all detailed product names. This is especially
useful if you are logging KMS requests. If you don&rsquo;t
log, there is no need to load an external KMS data file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If vlmcsd has
been compiled to use a default KMS data file, you may use
<b>-j-</b> to ignore the default configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-r0</b>, <b>-r1</b>
(default) and <b>-r2</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">These options determine how
ePIDs are generated if</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">- you did not
sprecify an ePID in the command line and <br>
- you haven&rsquo;t used <b>-i</b> or <br>
- the file specified by <b>-i</b> cannot be opened or <br>
- the file specified by <b>-i</b> does not contain an ePID
for the KMS request</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-r0</b>
means there are no random ePIDs. vlmcsd simply issues
default ePIDs that are built into the binary at compile
time. <b>Pro:</b> behaves like real KMS server that also
always issues the same ePID. <b>Con:</b> Microsoft may start
blacklisting again and the default ePID may not work any
longer.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-r1</b>
instructs vlmcsd to generate random ePIDs when the program
starts or receives a SIGHUP signal and uses these ePIDs
until it is stopped or receives another SIGHUP. Most other
KMS emulators generate a new ePID on every KMS request. This
is easily detectable. Microsoft could just modify sppsvc.exe
in a way that it always sends two identical KMS requests in
two RPC requests but over the same TCP connection. If both
KMS responses contain the different ePIDs, the KMS server is
not genuine. <b>-r1</b> is the default mode. <b>-r1</b> also
ensures that all three ePIDs (Windows, Office 2010 and
Office 2013) use the same OS build number and LCID (language
id).</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If vlmcsd has
been started by an internet superserver, <b>-r1</b> works
almost identically to <b>-r2</b>. The only exception occurs
if you send more than one activation request over the same
TCP connection. This is simply due to the fact that vlmcsd
is started upon a connection request and does not stay in
memory after servicing a KMS request. Consider using
<b>-r0</b> or <b>-w</b>, <b>-G</b>, <b>-0</b>, <b>-3</b> and
<b>-6</b> when starting vlmcsd by an internet
superserver.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-r2</b>
behaves like most other KMS server emulators with random
support and generates a new random ePID on every request.
<b>-r2</b> should be treated as debugging option only
because it allows very easy emulator detection.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-C</b> <i>LCID</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Do not randomize the locale id
part of the ePID and use <i>LCID</i> instead. The
<i>LCID</i> must be specified as a decimal number, e.g. 1049
for &quot;Russian - Russia&quot;. This option has no effect
if the ePID is not randomized at all, e.g. if it is selected
from the command line or an ini file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">By default
vlmcsd generates a valid locale id that is recognized by
.NET Framework 4.0. This may lead to a locale id which is
unlikely to occur in your country, for instance 2155 for
&quot;Quecha - Ecuador&quot;. You may want to select the
locale id of your country instead. See
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/goglobal/bb964664.aspx">MSDN</a>
for a list of valid <i>LCID</i>s. Please note that some of
them are not recognized by .NET Framework 4.0.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Most other KMS
emulators use a fixed <i>LCID</i> of 1033 (English - US). To
achive the same behavior in vlmcsd use <b>-C 1033</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-K0</b>, <b>-K1</b>,
<b>-K2</b> and <b>-K3</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Sets the whitelisting level to
determine which products vlmcsd activates or refuses. The
default is <b>-K0</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:29%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-K0</b>:
activate all products with an unknown, retail or
beta/preview KMS ID. <b><br>
-K1</b>: activate products with a retail or beta/preview KMS
ID but refuse to activate products with an unknown KMS ID.
<b><br>

products with a retail or beta/preview KMS ID. <b><br>

<p>The SKU ID is not checked. Like a genuine KMS server
vlmcsd activates a product that has a random or unknown SKU
ID. If you select <b>-K1</b> or <b>-K3</b>, vlmcsd also
checks the Application ID for correctness. If Microsoft
introduces a new KMS ID for a new product, you cannot
activate it if you used <b>-K1</b> or <b>-K3</b> until a new
version of vlmcsd is available.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-c0</b> and <b>-c1</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>-c1</b> causes vlmcsd to
check if the client time differs no more than four hours
from the system time. <b>-c0</b> (the default) disables this
check. <b>-c1</b> is useful to prevent emulator detection. A
client that tries to detect an emulator could simply send
two subsequent request with two time stamps that differ more
than four hours from each other. If both requests succeed,
the server is an emulator. If you specify <b>-c1</b> on a
system with no reliable time source, activations will fail.
It is ok to set the correct system time after you started
vlmcsd.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-M0</b> and <b>-M1</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Disables (<b>-M0</b>) or
enables (<b>-M1</b>) maintaining a list of client machine
IDs (CMIDs). The default is <b>-M0</b>. <b>-M1</b> is useful
to prevent emulator detection. By maintaing a CMID list,
vlmcsd reports current active clients exactly like a genuine
KMS emulator. This includes bug compatibility to the extent
that you can permanently kill a genuine KMS emulator by
sending an &quot;overcharge request&quot; with a required
client count of 376 or more and then request activation for
671 clients. vlmcsd can be reset from this condition by
restarting it. If <b>-M0</b> is used, vlmcsd reports current
active clients as good as possible. If no client sends an
&quot;overcharge request&quot;, it is not possible to detect
vlmcsd as an emulator with <b>-M0</b>. <b>-M1</b> requires
the allocation of a buffer that is about 50 kB in size. On
hardware with few memory resources use it only if you really
need it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If you start
vlmcsd from an internet superserver, <b>-M1</b> cannot be
used. Since vlmcsd exits after each activation, it cannot
maintain any state in memory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-E0</b> and <b>-E1</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">These options are ignored if
you do not also specify <b>-M1</b>. If you use <b>-E0</b>
(the default), vlmcsd starts up as a fully
&quot;charged&quot; KMS server. Clients activate
immediately. <b>-E1</b> lets you start up vlmcsd with an
empty CMID list. Activation will start when the required
minimum clients (25 for Windows Client OSses, 5 for Windows
Server OSses and Office) have registered with the KMS
server. As long as the minimum client count has not been
reached, clients end up in HRESULT 0xC004F038 &quot;The
count reported by your Key Management Service (KMS) is
insufficient. Please contact your system
administrator&quot;. You may use <b>vlmcs</b>(1) or another
KMS client emulator to &quot;charge&quot; vlmcsd. <b>-E1</b>
does not improve emulator detection prevention. It&rsquo;s
primary purpose is to help developers of KMS clients to test
&quot;charging&quot; a KMS server.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-R</b>
<i>renewal-interval</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Instructs clients to renew
activation every <i>renewal-interval</i>. The
<i>renewal-interval</i> is a number optionally immediately
followed by a letter indicating the unit. Valid unit letters
are s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days) and w
(weeks). If you do not specify a letter, minutes is
assumed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-R3d</b> for
instance instructs clients to renew activation every 3 days.
The default <i>renewal-interval</i> is 10080 (identical to
7d and 1w).</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Due to poor
implementation of Microsofts KMS Client it cannot be
guaranteed that activation is renewed on time as specfied by
the -R option. Don&rsquo;t care about that. Renewal will
happen well before your activation expires (usually 180
days).</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Even though you
can specify seconds, the granularity of this option is 1
minute. Seconds are rounded down to the next multiple of
60.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-A</b>
<i>activation-interval</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Instructs clients to retry
activation every <i>activation-interval</i> if it was
unsuccessful, e.g. because it could not reach the server.
The default is 120 (identical to 2h).
<i>activation-interval</i> follows the same syntax as
<i>renewal-interval</i> in the <b>-R</b> option.</p>

signals differ from the default behavior: <b><br>
SIGTERM</b>, <b>SIGINT</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">These signals cause vlmcsd to
