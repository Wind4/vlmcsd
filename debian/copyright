 .
 These macros operate a stack of objects.  Each object starts life
 small, and may grow to maturity.  (Consider building a word syllable
 by syllable.)  An object can move while it is growing.  Once it has
 been "finished" it never changes address again.  So the "top of the

 stack is of mature, fixed size and fixed address objects.
 .
 These routines grab large chunks of memory, using a function you
