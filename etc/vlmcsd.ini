# Sample vlmcsd.ini
#
# An ini file for vlmcsd is normally not required. It is for advanced users only.
# vlmcsd uses an ini file only if specified using the -i option in the command line parameters.
# There is no default ini file because vlmcsd is designed to run on many platforms.
#
# Every line starting with a number sign (#) or semicolon (;) is treated as a comment.
# If a key word is used more than once, the last occurrence is used. The only exception
# to this is Listen. You can use Listen=<ip address>[:port] more than once.
